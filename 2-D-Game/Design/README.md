## **Design:**
Design is important for the structure and the functionality of the project. The design aspects of this project was defined in Lab #3 and Lab #4. 

In Lab 3, Software Architecture and Conceptual Model the team utilized the requirements and use cases defined prior and defined a software architecture conceptual model. 

In Lab 4, Requirement Analysis and Behaviour models the team refined the requirements through constructring conceptual models like, state diagrams and sequence diagrams. The interactions that occur in the system and state models are used to capture the dynmaic behavior of the software system. 

## Attributes Table:
The attributes table contains attributes of classes extracted from the user story. 

## Class Diagram:

The class diagram depicts the major classes that have been implemented in developing Ball Out-2.
Each class has attributes and methods, as well as relationships with other classes. 


## Class Level Sequence Diagram:

The class level sequence diagram shows how all classes in the website work and are connected to one another. 

## Class Responsibilities Table: 

The class responsibilities table is a table that contains the classes extracted from the user story as well as a description of how each class functions in the system. 

## Prototype:

The prototype illustrates a sample of the structure and how the interface of Ball Out-2 works. 

## Relationships Table: 

The relationships table contains the various relationships between several components extracted from the user story. 

## State Model Diagram:

The state diagram depicts the various states the user will interact with on our 2-D game web based application. 
This model illustrates from start to finish how the system works. 


## System Level Diagram:

This system level diagram is a detailed conceptual model that depicts how the system functions.
