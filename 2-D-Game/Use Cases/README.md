## **Use Cases:**

Use cases provide a detailed desciption on how the system behaves and helps to capture the purpose of the system and describes the goals of the users, as well as refining the requirements to meet stakeholder needs. 

Use cases provided a basis for this project, to capture the user requrirments. Through lab 1 this was done through creating a jam board to discuss ideas, use cases and the creation of CRC cards. This folder contains these contents as well as a use case diagram that illustrates how the system interacts with the stakeholders, as well as a user story that provides a detailed scenario written in the perspective of the end user and use case specifications that involved refining the requirements in detail.
